1. PROJECT TITLE
   - Google Colab Jupyter Notebook for Classification Tasks

2. DESCRIPTION
   - This project contains a Jupyter notebook that implements three different models for classification tasks. The notebook is divided into three parts, each implementing a different model.

3. MODELS
   - The models used are in a single notebook, each part is clearly outlined in the code and below:
   - Part 1: SVM Model for Binary Classification
     - This part of the notebook implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for the binary classification task.
   - Part 2: RFC Model for Binary Classification
     - This part of the notebook implements a Random Forest Classifier (RFC) model for the same binary classification task.
   - Part 3: RFC Model for Multiclass Classification
     - This part of the notebook implements an RFC model for the multiclass classification task.

4. REQUIREMENTS
   - This notebook is designed to run on Google Colab and may require certain Python packages to be installed. Please refer to the first cell of the notebook for the specific packages needed.

5. USAGE
   - To use this notebook, open it in Google Colab at the following link: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1L_AI-7o4V5_CZEzNtxnv0YCTxkZQE2fF?usp=sharing
   - Ensure all required packages are installed, the four datasets required are in the same folder (shown below), and run the cells in order from top to bottom.
